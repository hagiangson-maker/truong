hey guys who download my files.
I am Truong
do you want to play it?
if yes then you have to do the following steps:
1. download all my files and put them in a folder named :"forest-suviral"
2. put the forest-suviral file just now on Desktop
3. download the Node.js file on the website https://nodejs.org/
4. complete Node.js
5. find and enable Command Prompt
6. write: cd Desktop\forest-suviral then enter
7. write: npm install then enter and wait a while
8. when the links are displayed then you ctrl + click on http://localhost:3000/
9. finally, after you ctrl + click on http://localhost:3000/ then the website will appear for you to play with the condition that you still keep Command Prompt
if you turn off Command Prompt for some reason or accidentally turn it off then it's okay. you just need to do the following:
1. open a new Command Prompt and write: cd Desktop\forest-suviral then enter
2. write: npm run dev then enter
3. ctrl + click on http://localhost:3000/
